# AI Content Detector (AI-CD) Application

## Overview

The AI Content Detector (AI-CD) is a web application designed to help users determine whether a given text is likely to have been generated by an AI or written by a human. The application consists of a Flask-based backend API for AI content detection and a React-based frontend for user interaction.

## Project Overview

The AI Content Detector application is divided into two main parts:

1. **Backend**: A Flask API that provides AI content detection capabilities, supporting both text input and file uploads (PDF, DOCX, TXT). The API uses Redis for session management and requires API key authentication.
2. **Frontend**: A React application built with Vite, providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the AI detection service.

## Backend Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Redis server running (for session management)
- Required Python packages (Flask, Redis, etc.)

## Version Control

### Initializing the Repository

To initialize a new Git repository and set up the remote origin, use the following commands:

```bash
git init
git remote add origin https://gitlab.cs.uct.ac.za/capstone25/aicd.git
```

### Cloning the Repository

To clone the repository, use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.cs.uct.ac.za/capstone25/aicd.git
```


The server will start on `http://0.0.0.0:5000` by default.

## Frontend Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18 or higher)
- npm (version 9 or higher)

### Installation for Frontend

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server, and you can access the application at `http://localhost:5173`.

3. Install and Run Storybook for Component Based UI Development and Testing:

```bash
npx storybook@latest init

npm run storybook
```

### Installation for Backend

1. Installation
```powershell
# Run the automated setup script
.\install_quick.ps1
```

1. Run/Start
```powershell
# Run the automated start script
.\start.ps1
```

## Usage

### Backend

The backend API provides several endpoints for AI content detection, history management, and session information. For detailed usage, refer to the [Backend API Documentation](backend/README.md).

### Frontend

The frontend provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the AI detection service. Users can input text or upload files for analysis, view detailed results, and manage their analysis history. For detailed usage, refer to the [Frontend Documentation](frontend/README.md).

## API Endpoints

For a comprehensive list of API endpoints and their usage, refer to the [Backend API Documentation](backend/README.md).
