# AI Content Detector (AI-CD) Application

## Overview

The AI Content Detector (AI-CD) is a web application designed to help users determine whether a given text is likely to have been generated by an AI or written by a human. The application consists of a Flask-based backend API for AI content detection and a React-based frontend for user interaction.

## Project Overview

1. **Backend**: A Flask API that provides AI content detection capabilities, supporting both text input and file uploads (PDF, DOCX, TXT). The API uses Redis for session management and requires API key authentication.
2. **Frontend**: A React application built with Vite, providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the AI detection service.
3. **Model Trainer**: Where the Huggingface ELECTRA Transformer has been trained from.

## Backend Setup

### Prerequisites
