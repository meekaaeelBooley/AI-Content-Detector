## Project Overview

The AI Content Detector is a web application designed to help users determine whether a given text is likely to have been generated by an AI or written by a human. This frontend project provides the user interface for interacting with the AI detection service.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18 or higher)
- npm (version 9 or higher)

### Installation


1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the Vite development server, and you can access the application at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several directories:

- **`public`**: Contains static assets such as the favicon and Vite logo.
- **`src`**: The main source code directory.
  - **`components`**: Reusable UI components.
  - **`features`**: Pages and related components for specific features.
  - **`services`**: API calls and utilities.
  - **`stories`**: Storybook configurations.
- **`vite.config.js`**: Configuration for Vite.
- **`eslint.config.js`**: Configuration for ESLint.
- **`index.html`**: The main HTML file.
- **`package.json`**: Project dependencies and scripts.

## Components

The project includes several reusable components:

- **Button**: A customizable button component.
- **FileAttachmentIndicator**: Displays information about an attached file.
- **Header**: The main header component.
- **HighlightedText**: Highlights text based on AI detection results.
- **Icon**: A wrapper for icons from `react-icons`.
- **Metric**: A circular progress indicator for displaying metrics.
- **Panel**: A navigation panel with buttons.
- **TextInput**: A text input component with file attachment support.

## Features

The project includes the following features:

- **AI Text Detector Page**: Allows users to input text or upload files for AI detection.
- **History Page**: Displays a list of previous analyses and detailed results.
- **Home Page**: Provides an overview of the project and a "Get Started" button.

## Development

### Running the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts the Vite development server and watches for changes.

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This builds the project for production, optimizing the code and assets.

### Previewing the Production Build

```bash
npm run preview
```

This starts a server to preview the production build.

## Testing

### Storybook

Storybook is used for developing and testing UI components in isolation. To start Storybook:

```bash
npm run storybook
```

### Running Storybook Tests

We use Storybook's test runner to ensure our components render correctly and behave as expected. Before running the tests, you must start Storybook to ensure the components are available for testing. To set up and run Storybook tests:

1. Install the test runner as a development dependency:

   ```bash
   npm install -D @storybook/test-runner
   ```

2. Start Storybook:

   ```bash
   npm run storybook
   ```

3. Run the tests using the following command in a separate terminal:

   ```bash
   npx test-storybook
   ```

This command will execute the tests defined in the `.stories.jsx` files for each component. The test runner will check for any rendering issues or unexpected behavior in the components.

### Example Test Output

Here is an example of the output you might see when running the tests:

### What is Being Tested?

These tests are designed to ensure that each component renders correctly and behaves as expected under various conditions. The tests cover:

- **Rendering**: Ensuring that the components render without errors.
- **Interactivity**: Checking that interactive elements (like buttons and inputs) work as intended.
- **Visual Consistency**: Verifying that the components look as expected in different states.

### Linting

ESLint is used for linting the code. To run ESLint:

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Deployment

The project can be deployed using Vite's build output. The production build is generated in the `dist` directory.

## License

This project is developed for academic purposes as part of CSC3003S coursework at the University of Cape Town.
