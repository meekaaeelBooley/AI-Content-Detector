Fire safety is near non-existent in Nepal. There was a single fire brigade for the entire city of Kathmandu. Once again. One single fire brigade for the capital city with a population of 1.4 million. There is basically no regulation for household items to be fire resistant. There is no regulation for egress during a fire and there's basically no regulation for building code. Now imagine all of that made worse from corruption, incompetence, profit incentives and a very frustrated population's want to burn down the property of the elites.
