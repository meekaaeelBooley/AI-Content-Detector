This file handles all the file upload processing.
It can read PDF, DOCX, and TXT files and extract the text content.

The File Processing Pipeline:
    Validation: Checks if file is safe and supported.
    Temporary Storage: Saves upload to a temp file (required by extraction libraries).
    Text Extraction: Uses different libraries based on file type.
    Cleanup: Always deletes temp files to avoid disk clutter.

Supported File Types & How Theyre Handled:
    PDF: Uses PyPDF2 to read each page and extract text.
    DOCX: Uses python-docx to read paragraphs from Word documents.
    TXT: Simple file reading with encoding fallback (UTF-8 to Latin-1)

Safety Features:
    File Type Whitelist: Only allows specific extensions, prevents executable uploads.
    Size Limits: Prevents huge files that could crash our server
    Temporary Files: Uploads are never permanently stored on server.

Key Technical Details:
    empfile.mkstemp(): Creates secure temporary files with unique names.
    finally block: Ensures cleanup happens even if extraction fails
    Encoding fallback: Handles text files with different character encodings.
    Chunked reading: Processes large files efficiently without loading everything into memory

Why We Need Temporary Files:
    The text extraction libraries (PyPDF2, python-docx) need actual files on disk to work with. We can't just pass them the uploaded file data directly.
